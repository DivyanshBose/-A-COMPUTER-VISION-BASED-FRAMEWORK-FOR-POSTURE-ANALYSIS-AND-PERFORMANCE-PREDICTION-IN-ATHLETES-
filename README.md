**A COMPUTER VISION BASED FRAMEWORK FOR POSTURE ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE PREDICTION IN ATHLETES**

**Project Overview**

A framework which uses 3D pose estimation technique and parameters like distance offset and inclination between neck and torso to analyze athletes’ postures and motions during any sporting activity in order to predict the correctness of an athlete’s posture.

**Key Features**
1. Pose detection of athletes during various sports activities.
2. Posture Analysis based on keypoints.
3. Integration with OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and Matplotlib for comprehensive functionality.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
3. NumPy
4. Mediapipe
5. Matplotlib
